I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics (Public Finance & Taxation) at Jinan University (research: taxation reform’s labor market impact, hukou policy effects; skilled in Stata/Python/R) and a full-time Lecturer at Guangzhou College of Commerce (taught 3 core courses to 500+ undergraduates, advised 5 national tax competition-winning teams) . With published taxation-related peer-reviewed papers, I aim for postdoctoral roles in labor economics/fiscal policy or positions at international organizations.
